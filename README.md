### Project Outline 
A computational simulation was created to model cell interaction with an environment under the advising of Dr. Jonathan Dawson. 
The model simulates cell-cell interaction and cell-field interaction. The model 
was created using MATLAB. 

Modeling was based off of experimental results attained from Developmental 
Biology's paper *Physiological electric fields induce directional migration of mammalian cranial neural crest cells*, 2020, as well as 
Dr. Jonathan Dawson's previous work *Cell-cell interactions and fluctuations in
the direction of motility promote directed migration of osteoblasts in direct 
current electrotaxis*, 2022.
