Working to implement changes onto pressure for better visualization 
and implement cell death aspect

Cell death based on cell-cell heavy paper via apoptosis: 2 ways to achieve

interactions between cells or fields. 
Most changes made to RadGrowth. Cell death is based on the key idea 'exempt' 
which exempts the dead cell from any interaction, treating it as dead
