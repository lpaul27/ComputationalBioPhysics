Working to implement changes onto pressure for better visualization 
and implement cell death aspect
Cell death based on cell-cell heavy paper via apoptosis: 2 ways to achieve
one is random cell death (highly unlikely) or critical pressure from force 
interactions between cells or fields. 
Most changes made to RadGrowth. Cell death is based on the key idea 'exempt' 
which exempts the dead cell from any interaction, treating it as dead.

Debugging of cell death and dynamic RGB changes in cells. Issue was in
simple changes in RadGrowth file in the access of which cells were able to change the
RGB values due to a faulty if/else statement.  
Next implementation is going to be debugging further and more rigorous tets in death/RGB pressure
as well as optimizing for computational efficiency in various files and
working to impliment better mitosis dynamics.

General Debugging; ready for a larger simulation to run with all other types of parameters experiencing no bugs.  
Planning to pursue accurate, large amounts of data and plots with simulation.
